%% Problem #1: LU factorization and its application to solve linear systems
%%Part A: New version of forward elimination to perform Doolittle-LU factorization
%%Part B: Using just the output of the factorization and a back-substitution function 
%%Solve the test linear system of equations given in the test problem
%%Part C: Use your LU factorized test matrix to set up a solution 
%%for the this system with different right hand sides

soln = @DoolittleLU; 
x = soln(A,b,b2,b3);
disp('%%%%%%%%End Part A, B, C Solution:%%%%%%%');

%%Part D: Use your LU factorization function and multiple right-hand side solution 
%%(using forward and back substitution as in part c) to find a matrix inverse 
%%for the test problem defined by the A and bj matrices in testproblem.mat.

%%Part A and B: Starting with the Jacobi function source code from the 
%repository create a new function that implements successive over-relaxation.
%Try this solver on the iterative test problem in this directory 
%Show that it gives the same results as the built-in Matlab utilities.

%%Part C and D: By repeated application of your solver, iteratively adjust the relaxation 
%parameter until you find the approximate value that minimizes the number of iterations needed to achieve converge. 
%Use a fairly strict convergence criteria, e.g. 10âˆ’6 or less.
%How many fewer iterations are needed for your optimal case vs. t
%the standard Gauss-Seidel algorithm (relaxation parameter of one).
%Approximately speaking which values of relaxation parameter (if any) 
%perform worse than Gauss-Seidel?
