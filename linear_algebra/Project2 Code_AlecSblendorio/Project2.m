%%Part C and D: By repeated application of your solver, iteratively adjust the relaxation 
%parameter until you find the approximate value that minimizes the number of iterations needed to achieve converge. 
%Use a fairly strict convergence criteria, e.g. 10âˆ’6 or less.
%How many fewer iterations are needed for your optimal case vs. t
%the standard Gauss-Seidel algorithm (relaxation parameter of one).
%Approximately speaking which values of relaxation parameter (if any) 
%perform worse than Gauss-Seidel?
